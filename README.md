Windows Activation Key Grabber

It kinda just does what it says on the tin. It grabs and neatly displays windows activation keys. Currently only outputs into terminal as the .txt ouput it originally had broke when I added the .bat soooo, yeah maybe i add it back maybe i dont idk.

I'm aware of the redundant admin text at the top, I forgot and cba at time of writing lol. Also you need to press enter 3 times to exit, instead of 1. Oops

This is by no means foolproof, or the best, or most efficient way to do things, but it's my first go at making a thing properly sooo here it is.
